#Serenity - AI Wellness Companion

![Banner](banner.png)

**Serenity** is your real-time AI wellness companion, designed to enhance emotional well-being by analyzing emotions through text and facial expressions. Powered by Groq, Serenity provides fast, accurate, and meaningful insights into your emotions to help you manage stress, track your mental health, and stay emotionally balanced.

##üöÄ Project Overview
Project Name: Serenity
Hackathon: Groq Hackathon
Team Members:

Mohit Pradhan - AI Modules (Text and Facial Emotion Detection)

Sambhav - Cloud Integration

Aditya - Backend Development

Mahima - UI/UX Design

##üß† Project Goal
Serenity‚Äôs mission is to provide emotional support in a fast-paced world. It uses cutting-edge AI technology to detect and analyze emotions from two key modalities:

Text Emotion Detection: Real-time emotion analysis from user input.

Facial Emotion Detection: Detecting emotions from facial expressions in real-time.

##üåü Key Features:
Emotion Detection: Accurately detects emotions from text (happy, sad, angry, etc.).

Facial Expression Analysis: Real-time facial recognition and emotion classification.

Instant Feedback: Provides users with emotional insights and real-time feedback on their mood.

##üõ† Technologies Used:
Groq: Fast emotion inference engine for both text and facial emotion detection.

Python: Core programming language for AI and backend logic.

TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework for training emotion detection models.

OpenCV: Used for real-time facial emotion detection.

Flask: Web framework for creating the backend API.

Heroku: For hosting the backend application (for demo purposes).

##üèÅ Quick Start Guide
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Serenity.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd Serenity
3. Set up a virtual environment:
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
4. Install required dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Set up environment variables:

6. Run the backend API:
bash
Copy
Edit
python backend/app.py
7. Access the application:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or the hosted URL if deployed on Heroku).

##üß† Emotion Detection Models
Text Emotion Detection
Serenity uses a pre-trained emotion analysis model to classify the user‚Äôs emotional state from text. Leveraging Groq's AI capabilities, it provides real-time analysis of the user's mood based on their written words.

Facial Emotion Detection
Serenity detects emotions in real-time through facial expressions. Using OpenCV, the system processes camera inputs and recognizes emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.

##üí° Hackathon Submission
Final Deliverables:
A multimodal emotion detection system (text + facial).

User Interface that provides real-time emotional insights.

A backend API integrated with the AI models for smooth interaction.

Complete Documentation for easy setup and use.

##üöÄ Future Enhancements
After the hackathon, we plan to:

Add more emotions and personalized insights.

Improve accuracy and real-time performance for facial emotion detection.

Build mobile and web applications for greater accessibility.
